# Monitoring System with Grafana, Prometheus, and PostgreSQL

This project provides a basic setup for a monitoring system using Grafana, Prometheus, PostgreSQL, and a PostgreSQL exporter. Below are details about the included services and how to run them.

## RESULTS
### Monitoring System
![Alt text](docs/monitoring.png)


## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system before starting.

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Project Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anyel-ec/Monitoring-BD-Grafana-Prometheus-Postgres
cd Monitoring-BD-Grafana-Prometheus-Postgres
```

## Project Structure

The project is configured using Docker Compose and consists of the following services:

- **grafana**: Visualization and monitoring dashboard.
- **prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting system.
- **postgres**: PostgreSQL database for storing system data.
- **postgres-exporter**: Metrics exporter for PostgreSQL, allowing Prometheus to collect database metrics.

## Using Docker Compose

To start all services, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will launch all containers in daemon mode (`-d`), allowing them to run in the background.

### Accessing Services

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the following services from your web browser:

- **Grafana**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin (specified in `docker-compose.yml` under `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
  
- **Prometheus**: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

- **PostgreSQL Exporter**: Metrics are available at [http://localhost:9187/metrics](http://localhost:9187/metrics)

### Additional Configuration

- **Data Persistence**:
  - Grafana: Data is stored in the `grafana_storage` volume.
  - PostgreSQL: Database data is stored in the `./backup` directory on your local machine.
  
- **Prometheus Configuration**:
  - The `prometheus.yml` configuration file is mounted into the Prometheus container to specify scraping targets. Make sure to modify this file according to your specific needs.

## Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop and remove the containers, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop the services and remove the containers, while keeping persistent data based on the volume configurations specified in `docker-compose.yml`.
